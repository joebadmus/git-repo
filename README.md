# git-repo
Explanation and Improvements:

Clear and Concise Docstrings: The functions now have docstrings that explain their purpose, arguments, and potential exceptions.
Descriptive Variable Names: The variable waitMilliseconds has been renamed to wait_seconds for consistency and readability in Python conventions.
Exception Handling: The wait_no_assertion_failure function raises a more informative AssertionError message when the maximum retries are reached.
time.sleep() Usage: Both functions use time.sleep(wait_seconds) to introduce delays between retries, ensuring a more accurate waiting mechanism.
return Statement: The return statement in the wait_until function has been simplified for clarity.
Function Names: The function names are maintained to provide a clear connection to the original C# code.
